# text_classification_project


For my two source bodies, I choose poems written by Female poets and male poets in India during the struggle for independence. The new texts I compared them with was with male and female poets from Britain and America when they were going through war times and independence struggles. 

The results of my comparison was very interesting with the writing style of Female poets of Britain being more like Male poets of India, Male Poets of Britain  being more similar to Male poets of India, Female Poets of America  being more similar to the Female Poets of India and Male Poets of America  being more similar to  the  Male poets of India. 

The results from my other feature: words with the maximum probability of being a common word, were also very interesting with the most common words from each of the poets being:

Female poets from India:{'love': 24, 'my': 26, 'rights': 19, 'responsibility': 20, 'lord': 50, 'alas': 12, 'you': 15, 'your': 18}
Male poets from India:{'freedom': 14, 'my': 19, 'i': 17, 'lord': 18, 'protect': 12}
Female poets from Britain:{'you': 224, 'i': 188}
Male poets from Britain:{'we': 24, 'you': 25, 'lord': 24}
Female poets from America:{'his': 6, 'he': 7, 'rights': 35, 'responsibility': 12, 'you': 6, 'freedom': 7}
Male poets from America:{'lord': 48, 'war': 13, 'protect': 24}

It was interesting to observe that:
- the female poets from India and America have a high count of using the words 'rights' and  'responsibility'
